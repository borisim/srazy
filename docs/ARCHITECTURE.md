# Architecture Overview

## System Design

The Srazy web application follows a modern MVC-inspired architecture with clear separation of concerns.

### Frontend Layer

The frontend is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

- **HTML Templates**: Jinja2 templates with template inheritance
- **Styling**: CSS3 with CSS variables for easy theming
- **JavaScript**: Modular ES6+ JavaScript with utility functions

### Backend Layer

The backend uses Flask framework:

- **Application**: Main Flask app with route definitions
- **Configuration**: Environment-based configuration system
- **API**: RESTful API endpoints for client-server communication

### Static Assets

Static files are organized by type:

- `css/`: Stylesheets
- `js/`: JavaScript files
- `images/`: Image assets

## Data Flow

1. Client makes HTTP request to Flask application
2. Flask routes the request to appropriate handler
3. Handler processes the request and renders template or returns JSON
4. Response is sent back to the client
5. JavaScript enhances the user experience on the client side

## Scalability Considerations

- Stateless design allows for horizontal scaling
- Static assets can be served via CDN
- Database layer can be added for data persistence
- API can be extended for mobile apps or third-party integrations

## Security

- CSRF protection (Flask built-in)
- Environment-based secrets
- Input validation on forms
- Secure headers configuration
- HTTPS recommended for production
